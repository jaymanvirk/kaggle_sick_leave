# Sick Leave Analysis: Hypothesis tests using p-value


## Abstract
This time we're going to work with a tiny dataset of sick leave frequency by age and sex.
The data was collected over the year.

We'll try to answer these questions:
1. Do men always get sick more often than women or we have got that difference by random chance?
2. And the same question about people who are over and under 35 y.o.
